## Testing

pywebview uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing. To run tests, simply type `pytest tests` in the project root directory. Tests cover only trivial mistakes, syntax errors, exceptions and such, in other words there is no functional testing. Each test verifies that a pywebview window can be opened and exited without errors when run under different scenarios.
